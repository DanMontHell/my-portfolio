# **👋 Welcome to my profile**  

For many years I have played a video game called Football Manager that heavily relies on data to make in game decisions. This played a big part in my decision to upskill and deep dive into the world of **data analytics**.

I have a rich background in **digital marketing** which has given me first hand experience working with data to make decisions. This includes planning and buying media using algorythms, working with website and survey data to design marketing strategies, and reporting on the success of these activities using analytical platforms such as Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. 

I hold a **BA Hons in Business Administration** from the University of the West of England (UWE) and am currently completing a **Data Analytics program with Masterschool**, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, and Tableau**.
