# 👋 **About Me**  

For the longest time I have been playing a video game called *Football Manager*. It is a management simulator that provides players with a ton of data for making in-game decisions; What tactic to play, which players to pick for the next game, who to buy, what to focus on in training, etc. This formed the foundation for my love of data and ultimately my decision to upskill as a **Data Analyst**.

I have been working with data for more than 10 years, helping businesses recruit and retain customers through **Digital Marketing**. This included buying media using algorythms, working with website and survey data to design marketing strategies, and reporting on the success of these activities using analytical platforms such as Meta and Google Analytics.

I hold a **BA Hons in Business Administration** from the University of the West of England (UWE) and am currently completing a **Data Analytics program with Masterschool**, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, and Tableau**.
