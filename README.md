# 👋 **About Me**  

For the longest time I have been playing a video game called *Football Manager*. It is a management simulator that provides players with a ton of data for making in-game decisions — what tactics to use, which players to select, who to sign, and how to optimize training. This game sparked my love for data and ultimately led me to upskill as a **Data Analyst**.

I have been working with data for more than 10 years already. As a *Digital Marketing Specialist* I helped businesses recruit and retain customers. This included buying advertising space using algorythms, analysing website and survey data to design marketing strategies, and reporting on the success of these activities using analytical platforms such as Meta and Google Analytics.

I hold a **BA Hons in Business Administration** from the University of the West of England (UWE) and am currently completing a **Data Analytics program with Masterschool**, where I’ve gained hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, and Tableau**.
